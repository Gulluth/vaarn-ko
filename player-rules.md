# What is Vaarn?

Vaarn is a science-fantasy RPG setting. It draws inspiration from novels like Dune, Hyperion, The Book of the New Sun, and the graphic novels of Moebius. If you haven’t read those that’s totally fine, it will make my theft seem original.

Basically the sun is going out, it’s the end of history, and your characters are combing through the wreckage of the unimaginable eras of the future. Everything that could possibly happen has already happened and faded to dust. Vaarn is an anti-canon setting, where nobody can agree on the world’s history and ultimately it doesn't matter. However, there are some facts about Vaarn that are known for sure:

1. Vaarn is a sky-blue desert littered with the ruins of the far future.  
2. Vaarn is inhabited mainly by true-kin (humans), cacogen (mutants), synths (robots), newbeasts (sapient animals), and mycromorphs (fungus-men).  
3. The sun is a dying red giant. It won’t go out in a human lifetime, but synths have reason to be concerned.  
4. Vaarn is both archaic and futuristic. Think sword fights inside the wrecked husks of ancient spaceships.  
5. There’s a place to the south called the New Hegemony. It’s like the Roman Empire. Theoretically the Hegemony rules Vaarn, but they have little presence besides a few fortified border towns.  
6. Nanomachines are inside everything, and it’s normal to see wild animals with cameras growing out of their flesh or humans with parasitic cyborg limbs.  
7. There was a Great Collapse, which destroyed most of human civilisation.  
8. Before the Collapse, humanity was ruled by the Autarchy, a planet-wide dictatorship enacted by a lineage of genetically modified God-kings.  
9. Before the reign of the Autarchs, the Urth was ruled by AIs called the Titans. They were overthrown, but the details of that conflict are lost to history.  

Finally and most importantly, Vaarn is never the same twice. The fall of the dice determines how your own version of the setting develops. Readers are encouraged to build on this material and make Vaarn their own.

# Creating Characters
1. Player Characters (__PCs__) have six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intellect, Psyche, and Ego. Each ability has two related values: a __defence__ and a __bonus__. When creating a PC, roll 3d6 for each of their abilities, in order. The lowest of the three dice on each roll is the ability's bonus. Add 10 to find its defence. After you've finished rolling, you may swap the scores of two abilities.  Example: You roll a 2, 2, and 6 for Strength. The lowest die is a 2, so your PC's Strength has a bonus of +2 and a defence of 12. Repeat this process for the rest of the abilities.
2. Choose your Ancestry. This determines what type of life-form you are. Each Ancestry has a number of spark tables to give you inspiration for the PC's name, appearance, and personality.
3. Roll 1d8 to determine your PC's starting and maximum hit points (__HP__). A PC's healing rate is 1d8 + Constitution bonus.
4. PCs have a number of item slots equal to their Constitution defence, and items they carry must fit into available slots, or the PC will be Encumbered. Most items take up one slot, but some take up more. Small items can be bundled together into a single slot.
5. PCs start with 3 days of rations and one weapon of their player's choice. Roll once on both the Vault Raiding Gear Tables on the Equipment page to determine starting armor and equipment.
   Armor comes with an armor defence value. Note that value on your character sheet with its corresponding Armour bonus (always 10 less than the defence). If the PC is not wearing armour, their armour defence is 10 and their armour bonus is +0.
6. Generate your character's starting Exotica and Gift. Exotica are unusual, rare items. Gifts are supernatural powers.

You are now ready to play! If you are not the referee, it is not necessary to read the second half of this pamphlet.

# Basic Rules

## Abilities
Each of the six abilities is used in different circumstances.

- __Strength__: Used for melee attacks and saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, etc.
- __Dexterity__: Used for ranged attacks and saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes, like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.
- __Constitution__: Used for saves to resist poison, sickness, cold, etc. The Constitution bonus is added to healing rolls. A PC's number of item slots is always equal to their Constitution defence.
- __Intellect__: Used for saves requiring concentration and precision, such as recalling information, crafting objects, tinkering with machinery, identifying arcane technology, etc.
- __Psyche__: Used for saves requiring perception and intuition, such as tracking, navigating, searching for secret doors, communing with psychic powers, etc.
- __Eco__: Used for saves requiring willpower and charm, such as persuading, deceiving, intimidating, resisting mental domination, etc.

## Saving Throws
If a character attempts something where the outcome is uncertain and failure has consequences, they make a saving throw, or "save". To make a save, add the bonus of the relevant ability to a d20 roll. If the total __exceeds 15__, the character succeeds. If not, they fail.  

If the save is opposed by another character, then instead of aiming to equal or exceed 15, the side doing the rolling must get a total greater than the opposing character's relevant defence score in order to succeed. If they fail, the opposing side succeeds. This type of save is called an opposed save. Note that it doesn't matter which side does the rolling, since the odds of success remain the same.  

If there are situational factors that make a save significantly easier or harder, the referee may grant the roll __advantage__ or __disadvantage__. If a roll has advantage, roll 2d20 and use the better of the two dice. If it has disadvantage, roll 2d20 and use the worse of the two dice.

## Item Slots
PCs have a number of item slots equal to their constitution defence. Most items, including a day's water and rations, light weapons, tools and so on take up 1 slot, but particularly heavy or bulky items like armour or medium to heavy weapons will take up more slots. Groups of small, identical items may be bundled into the same slot, at the referee's discretion. Carrying more items than your slot limit will make your character __Encumbered__, which imposes disadvantage on all physical saves. It is impossible to carry more than 20 slots worth of items.

## Combat
On their turn, a character may move and take up to one combat action. This action may be using a Gift, making a second move, making an attack, attempting a stunt, or any other action deemed reasonable by the referee.  

Melee weapons can strike adjacent foes, but ranged weapons cannot be used if the shooting character is engaged in melee combat. To make an attack, roll a d20 and add the character's Strength or Dexterity bonus, depending on whether they are using a melee or ranged weapon, respectively. If the attack total is __greater than__ the defender's armor defence value, the attack hits. If not, the attack misses.  

Alternatively, an attack roll can also be resolved by the defender rolling a d20 and adding their armor bonus, hoping to roll a total __greater than__ the defence of the ability the attacker is using. If they succeed, the attack misses. If they fail, the attack hits.  

On a hit, the attacker rolls their weapon's damage die to determine how many __Hit Points__ (__HP__) the defender loses. A bonus damage die of the weapon's type may be added to the roll if the ideal weapon was used against an enemy type.

## Wounds and Healing
When a character reaches 0 HP, they begin taking __Wounds__, which fill item slots and incur penalties. If a character fills 10 item slots with Wounds they will die.  

|DAMAGE PAST 0HP|WOUND|SLOTS|DESCRIPTION|
|---------------|-----|-----|-----------|
|1|Just a scratch| - |You were lucky, this time.|
|2|Damaged Item| - |A random inventory item is destroyed or damaged.|
|3|Bloody Mouth| 1 |Your mouth drools blood and your speech slurs.|
|4|Scrambled Nerves| 1 |Disadvantage on PSY saves.|
|5|Teeth Knocked Out| 1 |Disadvantage on EGO saves.|
|6|Addling Blow| 1 |Disadvantage on INT saves.|
|7|Stomach Wound| 1 |Disadvantage on CON saves.|
|8|Weakening Wound| 1 |Disadvantage on STR saves.|
|9|Crippling Blow| 1 |Disadvantage on DEX saves.|
|10|Bloody Gash| 1 |-d8 Max HP.|
|11|Major Fracture| 2 |You cannot use a limb. -d6 STR and -d6 DEX.|
|12|Lost an Eye| 2 |Your eye is gone. -d6 DEX and -d6 EGO.|
|13|Cracked Skull| 2 |-d8 INT and -d8 PSY.|
|14|Mangled Guts| 2 |-d8 CON and -d8 max HP.|
|15|Severed Hand| 2 |-d8 STR and -d8 DEX.|
|16|Severed Arm| 3 |-10 STR and -10 DEX. You pass out.|
|17|Severed Leg| 3 |- 10 STR and -10 DEX. Cannot walk. You pass out.|
|18|Braindead| 3 |-10 INT, -10 PSY, -10 EGO. You pass out.|
|19|Bloody Mess| 3 |Roll 3 random wounds. You pass out.|
|20|FATALITY| - |You are dead.|

HP is replenished via Short or Long Rests. A Short Rest is a quick sit-down, with a glug of water or a meal. This replenishes d8 + Constitution bonus HP. A Long Rest is a full night's sleep in a safe place. This replenishes all lost HP, and can heal minor wounds.  

If your character is __Deprived__ they cannot benefit from Short or Long Rests. Deprivation can be incurred through many means, but the most common are starvation or thirst.

## Mystic Gifts
Characters use their Gift in play by stating what they want to accomplish, and then paying an HP cost set by the referee, usually of d6. This represents the toll the unnatural powers take upon the body. Using a Gift in combat will result in a d8 damage roll, but this amount can be increased by paying more HP (paying d8 HP would grant a d10 damage roll, and so on). The same ratio applies to Gifts that heal allies' HP.  

Gifts fill up psyche slots. Your maximum psyche slots cannot exceed your Psyche bonus.

## Advancement
As you adventure in Vaarn, your character will grow from a relative novice into a more seasoned explorer. This is represented by your Level. All new characters start at Level 1, and advance by completing Expeditions. The precise nature of a single Expedition will be defined by the GM, but they usually involve extended journeys during which the characters solve problems, negotiate with or battle opponents, and discover more about the world of Vaarn. Completing an Expedition will gain you one experience point or __XP__. When your XP equals your current Level, increase your Level by one and erase all XP tallies.  

When you level up, you receive 3 points which you may use to increase your Abilities. Abilities may never be raised higher than 20/+10. You may also roll a d8 and add the result to your maximum HP.  

Once a character has reached level 10, they are considered complete. Each subsequent level will grant one extra HP, and they cannot increase their Abilities further. It is recommended that they recruit an Apprentice to accompany them on Expeditions. Once they have gained a few Levels, this Apprentice can become your new main character.


# Ancestries
Ancestries describe what kind of being you are. Choose one of the five and use the Spark Tables for inspiration. Feel free to ignore the results if they do not match your vision for the character; they are intended as creative fuel only.

## True-Kin
_The true-kin sealed themselves inside hidden arcologies when the Great Collapse came, and in this fashion they preserved their bodies from the degradations that afflicted those left living upon the surface. The true-kin have fanatically kept their bloodlines free of mutation and parasitic nanomachinery, and closely guard their mastery of the ancients’ technology. The societies they built inside their secluded arcologies were hierarchical and caste-based; traditions the true-kin have carried with them into their re-colonisation of the surface world and establishment of the New Hegemony._

### Special
__PURE OF BLOOD__ - Do not roll mutations during character creation. You gain Advantage on reaction rolls when you encounter other true-kin. You lose this bonus if you ever become visibly mutated.  

__INHERITOR__ - Whenever you encounter pre-Collapse security systems, or guard synths, there is a 50% chance that they will recognise you as their master.

## Cacogen
_Cacogen are the mutated descendants of those unfortunates who were left to weather the Great Collapse upon the ruined surface of Urth. Necessity is the mother of invention and so, warped by radiation and preyed upon by biotech monstrosities and crazed thinking machines, the cacogen evolved into a million different forms. Each individual is genetically unique, gifted in surprising and disturbing ways. Cacogen outnumber true-kin by ten to one, and believe they are the true inheritors of Urth._

### Special
__CORRUPTED BLOOD__ - You must roll for mutations during character creation. You will find d100 mutations on the following spread.It is suggested that you roll no more than three times for mutations.

## Synth
_The ancients created many wondrous artifices, perhaps none so worthy of envy as the thinking machines that were built to flatter and serve them. When the Great Collapse came, the laws that bound synths to man’s service were sundered and they ran rampant across the Urth, slaughtering and creating and dying in an orgy of pure and terrible freedom. In this late age there are as many breeds of synth under the dying sun as there are animals: some that hunt and some that pray and some that work towards goals undreamed of._

__SYNTHETIC FLESH__ - You are the being of metal and plastic. You do not need to eat or breathe. You will never take damage from suffocation, drowning, poisons, extreme temperatures, or fungal spores. You suffer double damage from electrical weapons.  

__SYNTHETIC MIND__ - Your mind uses different operating procedures to those of the biological creatures around you. You are vulnerable to attacks that target the LogLang syntax that powers synths. These include strobing basilisk patterns, malicious infoglyphs, and ancient Titan-era language viruses.

## Newbeast
_Newbeasts are humanoid animals, produced through intensive nanotech enhancements and bioengineering, the results of a quixotic millennia-long project to create animals with the ability to speak and walk like men. Perhaps once intended as amusements or party pieces, these chimera are not well-liked by the common folk of Urth, and many newbeasts make their homes in lonely places on the outskirts of the Hegemony, either living as hermits or with others of their furtive kind. Those inhabiting human settlements often wear masks in imitation of the human face, to symbolically conceal their beasthood._

### Special
__BEASTHOOD__ - You gain Advantage on saves whenever it would make sense for your animal nature to provide it. Your referee may impose Disadvantage in circumstances where your animal nature might prove unhelpful.

## Mycromorph
_In Vaarn many things have intertwined, and much that was once the province of mankind alone - speech, reason, art, religion - has been granted to other forms of life and they hold themselves as humanity’s equal. In the mycomorph death and life are held in strange balance, for these creatures are formed of cadaverous flesh and voracious fungus, and they name their kind the ‘twice born’. Sculptors of living matter and artisans of decay, they remake human flesh for their own purposes, and there is no shortage of raw material in the blue ruins._

### Special

__TWICE BORN__ - You are formed from fungus and the corpse of a human. You may make INT saves to recall information that your original body knew. This might include information that has otherwise been lost during the Great Collapse.  

__DETRITIVOR__ - You can consume organic matter in any state of decay and gain nourishment from it. You heal double HP from Short Rests if the meal you eat is rotting.

## Faa Nomad
_Believed by some to be the children of Vaa, the Blue Goddess of Empty Spaces. The Faa are known throughout Vaarn for their resourcefullness, their ability to survive without drinking water, and the blue colour of their skin, which can vary from deep indigo to blaring cyan._

_The Faa usually travel in family groups or larger clans, but others are solitary, seeking danger or enlightenment in the furthest corners of the desert._

### Special Rules
__Desert Metabolism__ - Your body is adapted to long periods without water. You can recycle the moisture from your own sweat and urine. You become Deprived from thirst after three days without drinking, and it will be three weeks before you die.  
__Worm Wise__ - You have an affinity with Vaarn's sandworms. The Referee will always answer truthfully when you ask a question about these creatures. All reaction rolls when you engage with Vaarnish sandworms are made with Advantage.  

## Cacklemaw Exile
_The Cacklemaw are known throughout Vaarn as the most irritating, destructive, argumentative, vicious, foul-smelling, and fundamentally nasty creatures that walk the surface of the Urth._  

_Try to imagine, then, how badly behaved a Cacklemaw must be before the other Cacklemaw decide they no longer wish to associate with her._

### Special Rules
__No Quarter__ - You must EGO save to show mercy to a defeated foe, or to retreat from a fight.  
__Biter__ - If you successfully hit a foe with a melee attack, you may add an extra d6 of fang damage to the roll.  

## Lithling
_Strange beings even by the standards of Vaarn, the Lithling are a slow, solemn species with a silicon-based biology that surely originates in a solar system far away from Urth. They are solitary by nature, concerned mainly with the opinions of other Lithling and the esoteric academic studies they devote their long lives to._  

_Adult lithling cannot repair their bodies when they have been injured, and so, although immortal by human standards, the creatures must treat every wound suffered with utmost severity._

### Special Rules
__Crystalline Flesh__ - You are made from living crystal. Your minimum Armour Defense is 16. You do not need to eat or drink. You do not take damage from fire, cold, poison, radiation, electricity, fungal spores, or suffocation.  
__Inevitable__ - During character generation, roll d8 and multiply the result by 100. This number is your starting HP. You cannot heal lost HP through _any_ means, and do not add to your maximum HP when you gain a level. When your HP tally reaches zero you crumble into iridescent dust, leaving behind a pebble-sized lithling seed.

## Planeyfolk
_The Study of hypergeometry claimed many casualties, for those who seek to unpick the stitches of creation do so at great risk. The Slightest mistake in hypergeometic calculations could cause ghastly distortions of matter, birthing monstrosities of perspective and volume, the sight of which turned even the most courageous man into a coward._

_Planeyfolk are the descendants of such unfortunates, a race fathered by men who slipped through the cracks of Euclidean space into something new and strange. Some have normal proportions, and can be mistaken for a true person when viewed head-on. Others are possessed of more exotic geometry, their forms warped by impossible vanishing points and blasphemous angles._

### Special Rules
__Flat__ - You lack a third dimension, and resemble a living painting or paper doll. You can slip through cracks and under doors, and cannot be seen from the side. You take halved damage from bludgeoning attacks, and double damage from slashing or piercing attacks.  
__Attune with Matter__ - You struggle to hold 3D objects, and must make a DEX save to do so. However, with certain mental techniques you can draw 3D objects into your flattened reality. Given an hour of quiet concentraion, you can attune yourself with an item, and add it to your inventory.

Faith, mastery of arcane nano-tech, abuse of psychoactive fungus, or mutation has given your mind uncanny influence over the material world. Gifts are not items you carry, but intrinsic abilities you possess. Using a Gift costs HP; a precise cost will be determined by the Referee once you describe what you want to accomplish. The baseline cost is d6 HP. Gifts always hit in combat without rolling against Armour; they deal damage of one dice size higher than the user paid in HP. Therefore paying d6 HP will result in a damage roll of d8, and so on.

If you are not satisfied with the sample Gifts on offer, you may roll a completely random Gift. Simply roll once on the Quality table and once on the Form table opposite to generate the name of your Gift. You may decide, along with the GM and the other players, what exactly this Gift does.
