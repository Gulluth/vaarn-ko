The novels that have been the biggest influence are The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe, Dune by Frank Herbert, and Hyperion by Dan Simmons. Vaarn also owes a great deal to the artwork of Jean ‘Moebius’ Giraud, Kilian Eng, and the comics of Stathis Tsemberlidis and Lando. I have also been strongly inspired by the videogames Rain World and Caves of Qud. // Further Vaarn content, play reports, lore, and a downloadable character sheet can be found at [vaultsofvaarn.com](https://vaultsofvaarn.com).
