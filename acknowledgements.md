The novels that have been the biggest influence are The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe, Dune by Frank Herbert, and Hyperion by Dan Simmons. Vaarn’s aesthetic owes a lot to the artwork of Jean ‘Moebius’ Giraud, Kilian Eng, and Decadence Comics. I have also been inspired by the videogames Rain World and Caves of Qud. // I would like to thank everyone who bought, commented on, or downloaded the previous issues of this zine; it meant the world to me. I would also like to thank my Sunday gaming group, who were the first to explore Vaarn. // Further content, such as play reports and lore, can be found at [vaultsofvaarn.com](https://vaultsofvaarn.com).
