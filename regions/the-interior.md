# The Interior
---

The Interior is the name outsiders give to the trackless blue desert that forms Vaarn's heart. It is a harsh and inhospitable landscape, and has claimed the lives of many travellers over the millennia, but there are peoples and monsters and marvels to be discovered in the vastness. The Interior is traversed by wary trade caravans, terrorised by laughing Cacklemaw warbands, and inhabited by the Faa nomads, to whom this desert is not the Vaarnish Interior but rather the world entire. The deepest deserts also play host to Vaarn’s most spectacular and regal inhabitants: the gigantic sandworms, which strike awe into the hearts of all who are lucky enough to witness them.

The Interior is a land of extremes, where the days are searingly hot, while the desert nights can grow cold enough to induce frostbite. The region receives even less rain than Vaarn’s parched southern badlands, and water is such a precious commodity that to spit upon a Faa nomad is to honor them.

No accurate map has ever been drawn of the Vaarnish Interior: the territory seems to defy rational organisation. This is a place without borders, the horizon between blue sand and blue sky no longer a stark dividing line but rather a molten membrane that swims and drifts woozily in the sun’s wine-red heat, the land making and remaking itself just as a lizard sheds its skin. The blue sands retreat from the wind, revealing structures that have lain dry and deathless and undisturbed for aeons, and then those same restless dunes shroud the ruins once again, before a living soul can name them. This is a country vast and blue, as deep with secrets as the ocean and twice as capricious. No welcome here for adventurers, but rewards might be won amongst the sands that defy human imagination.

## Why Would My Players Travel Here?

Simply put, the Interior connects all regions of Vaarn to one another; the quickest route from Gnomon in the south to the Lazul Mountains in the north will always be directly across the sands; likewise a traveller from the Wall who wished to reach Ikor Quag or the Mooncradle Mountains would be obliged to charter a wind-barge and cross the deeps of the desert.

There are also reasons to make the Interior a destination in its own right. Most of Vaarn’s noteworthy ruins and vaults are located in the desert - the vastness and shifting nature of the place allows creative referees to place whatever kind of structure they can imagine in the Interior, without having to further justify its obscurity and isolation. There are also unique cultures that exist predominantly in the desert. Players who wish to locate a certain Faa nomad clan or Lithling scholar will find that they must brave the sandstorms and heatwaves in order to speak with them. 

Campaigns that focus on the Interior should revolve around movement, exploration, and discovery. If your players find the trading city [Gnomon](regions/gnomon.md) too claustrophobic, then give them an opportunity to enlist as guards for a merchant’s caravan, or let them come into possession of a small wind-barge and enjoy sailing wherever fate takes them. Other adventure starters in the Interior could include rescuing an important prisoner from a Cacklemaw warband, hunting down a notorious caravan robber in order to collect a bounty, or searching for the ruins of a biotech laboratory in order to discover the cure for a virulent disease.

# Desert Cultures
---

## Faa Nomads
The travelling people of the great blue desolation. The Faa have roamed the desert since the Titans were young (or so their songs say). Generations ago, the ancestors of the Faa bestowed upon their children genetic adaptations to the harsh conditions of the Interior. The most obvious of these changes is their flesh and hair, which have taken on a blue hue that matches the sands of Vaarn. Combined with the blue robes the nomads wear, they can swiftly become almost invisible amongst the azure dunes and rocks. The Faa also boast an impressive modified metabolism that allows them to survive for weeks without taking in fresh water, as their sweat and urine are collected and purified by sub-dermal biomechanisms and recycled into their bodies. Even the eyes of the Faa have been sculpted to survive in the desert: they possess a second set of translucent eyelids, which protect their vision during sandstorms. The nomads are also famously unable to produce tears, another modification that privileges water retention above all.

In truth the Faa are no single culture, but a mosaic of families and clans who share these genetic adaptations and a lingua franca known as the Faatongue. Faa groups are wildly varied in their beliefs and lifestyles. Most are nomadic, but some Faa make permanent homes in the foothills of the mountains or around a valuable water source. Some clans are feared slavers and warriors, but others are sworn to the Pale Faith of Amun-Oh and may harm no living creature. Some Faa are legal citizens of the New Hegemony; other clans are bitter enemies of the true-kin empire. Some Faa ostracise cacogen, synths, and newbeasts, while others welcome them. Faa nomads can be found everywhere in Vaarn, from the shadow of the Great Wall to the markets of Gnomon and the fortress monasteries that speckle the heights of the Lazul Mountains, and in each place there is no concordance on what it means to be Faa.

Perhaps the only true commonality is that all Faa are fiercely independent-minded, and will leave their clan rather than submit to an authority they believe unjust. This may be the reason it is impossible to define what the Faa hold in common - whenever one way of living is pronounced ideal, there will be within that group a minority who instantly declare the opposite, and set out alone to prove it.

The Faa clans of the Interior are known for a deep understanding of sandworm husbandry, and their ability to ride the creatures, as well as methods by which the worms’ growth may be arrested, to prevent them assuming their enormous, aggressive adult shapes. The sandworms have deep religious significance to many Faa, as their secretions are used to brew the valuable psychoactive substance known as Amaranthine Sugar, an enormously potent drug that can awaken extra-sensory perception even in minds that were not born with such gifts.

## Cacklemaw
They are newbeasts of a sort, although they disdain masks and seek no approval from humankind. In form the Cacklemaw are hyena-headed women, standing seven feet or more, with three-fingered hands and a terrible strength in their lanky limbs. The oaths that bound them as warriors in service of the Fallen Autarchy are long-since broken and these creatures are a blight upon humanity, killing and abducting at will and mounting daring raids into Hegemony territory. They respect strength alone, and perhaps they would have overrun the Urth by now if it was not for the constant intra-family bloodletting, as younger Cacklemaw challenge their elder sisters for status.

Two things stand out, aside from their love of violence: their mirth and their singular gender. On the first subject, the chronicler Markus of Dulcrest has written that ‘to the Cacklemaw, all waking activity is slaughter that descends into revelry; else it is revelry that descends into slaughter’. The creatures are famed for their screaming laughter, their love of practical jokes, and most of all for the grisly leather puppets they make from the remnants of defeated foes. Their religion is not well-understood, for rites are closed to outsiders, but it is known to revolve around a fool-capped puppet-demoness the Cacklemaw name ‘Grand-Mama Punch’, to whom they devote wild rites of bloodletting and clowning.

On the second subject, much has been written. Some theorise that there is an unseen caste of Cacklemaw males. Others claim the Cacklemaw are surely a clone race, emerging fully-grown from pseudowombs beneath the desert surface. Others still declare the bite of a Cacklemaw to be infectious, and believe human women are bitten by the creatures and painfully transform into new giggling monsters. Vaarnish maidens who laugh too long and too raucously, and are given to drink and loose behaviour, may be accused of having hidden Cacklemaw 
-marks festering on their bodies.

Cacklemaw swear allegiance to War Mamas, but these oaths are not binding and political support is won by the Mama who can best provide her daughters with food, drink, laughter, and violence. At present the dominant War Mamas are Mama Hecklehaw in the trackless Interior, Mama Gloatgrim in the southern badlands, and Mama Yawningfool in the Lazul mountains. Ageing matriarchs Nana Blacklaugh and Nana Rictus command small but devoted cadres of veteran fighters, who respect the older Nanas' tactical nous above the younger Mamas’ savage energy.

## Lithling
The Lithling are formed from a mesh of motile crystals, each shard attracted to its neighbours and animated by an energy field far beyond the understanding of Vaarnish scholars. They walk stiffly and ponderously, but have surprisingly dexterous fingers, and are capable of skilful manipulations of brushes, pens, and other delicate objects. They are fed by wavelengths of energy quite invisible to humanity and thus do not breathe, eat, or drink, a quality that makes them masters of the harshest environments imaginable. Lithling scholars have carried out extensive surveys of the toxic landscapes of Ikor Quag, and think nothing of spending years at a time submerged beneath the ocean or the surface of the desert, composing some treatise in their calcified minds.

The lithling life cycle is as alien to humanity as their bloodless bodies. Lithling are grown from a seed, which must crystallise and bloom in a deep bath of alchemical elixirs. After decades of maturation, they are deemed fully-moulded and allowed to awaken, as large and strong as they will ever be. They are inducted into the Lithic Lyceum by their kindred, and instructed in their duties as scholars.

Lithling have a scholarly, enquiring cast of mind, and are endlessly fascinated by the alien world of biological organisms they find themselves marooned on. The Lyceum is devoted to cataloging the minutiae of the natural world, and contains the life’s work of millions of long-dead lithling in its underground archives. Unfortunately, the records of the lithling are often of dubious usefulness to outsiders – their dissertations and essays tend to focus on the minutiae of data and experience while lacking the wider context that a human mind might find meaningful. One celebrated lithling study describes the movements made by generations of land-snails over a hundred year period, with the relative positions of each snail recorded by the second.

# Travel Rules
---

Travel is an integral element of running game sessions in Vaarn’s Interior. Although many readers will have travel procedures that they are accustomed to using, I felt it might benefit those who feel less confident about running overland travel to learn how I do it in my own Vaarn games. 

I don’t make use of detailed breakdowns of every six-mile hex between one destination or another. I use an abstracted system which boils down travel into two resources: **travel days** and **rations**. Characters need to spend both in order to make progress.

## Travel Days
Vaarn is not well-mapped, and it is not recorded exactly how far one must travel between locations. Distances given by NPCs are approximations, expressed in days: _‘From here it will take five days of travel to reach the circular ruins’_, for example. These estimates apply to speed on foot. If players are using a vehicle, divide the number of travel days in half.

Under normal conditions, the PCs can travel a half day’s worth of distance in the morning, and a half day’s worth of distance in the afternoon. At night they must eat a meal and rest.

## Rations
Rations are an abstraction of food and water carried. Five days’ worth of rations can be carried in a single inventory slot. Unless their Ancestry exempts them, PCs must consume a ration each day. If they do not, they become **Deprived**, and cannot recover lost HP. Characters who are Deprived due to hunger and thirst will die after three days.

Rations can be obtained from the bodies of dead opponents or allies, so long as the referee rules that the creature is made from an edible material. Convert the dead creature’s Hit Dice into rations at a ratio of 1:1.

_If you find numbers on a character sheet a bit abstract, you could use a bowl of poker chips to represent the players’ total rations. Have each player remove a poker chip from the bowl when they camp for the night, and add chips back in when they find fresh sources of nourishment._

## Exhaustion
At any point during the travel day, the players may declare that they are exerting themselves in order to walk faster than usual, or are piloting their vehicle at greater speeds than normal. If the party exerts themselves in this manner, they can travel two days’ worth of distance in one day. However, they must fill an inventory slot with **Exhaustion**.

Exhaustion cannot be removed from a PC’s inventory until they rest in one place for an **entire** day and night, with no distance being covered. If a PC has no more spare slots to fill with Exhaustion, they must discard an item to make room. A PC who fills ten inventory slots with Exhaustion will die.

## Getting Lost
Losing one’s way has never seemed particularly fun to me, and I assume the PCs are competent desert navigators, who will never get lost as long as they can see the sun and stars. However, some circumstances - players attempting to travel during a sandstorm, for example - demand it. In such cases roll a d6, and add the resulting number of days to their travel schedule.

## Encounters
The referee should check for an encounter once during the morning of a travel day, once during the afternoon, and once per night. This is done by rolling a d6, and consulting the results below:

**1 - Active Encounter.** The PCs encounter a creature or situation that definitely notices them, and will actively attempt to involve them in their business.  
**2 - Passing Encounter.** The PCs encounter a creature or situation in passing - it may be happening far away, or be a creature that is not interested in the PCs.  
**3 - Hint**. The PCs find a hint of an encounter. This may be an object or footprint left in the sand, a flying creature glimpsed on the horizon, or similar. The entity the Hint concerned will always appear as the next Active or Passing Encounter.  
**4-6 - Nothing.**  
_If the PCs are traveling in an extremely slow, noisy, or obvious manner, the referee may choose to roll 2d6 or even 3d6 for encounter checks, and use the lowest result._  

## Vigilance
At the start of each day, as you roll for encounters, the players may collectively roll a Vigilance Dice. This is a single d6, without modifiers. If the players roll a six, they have a guarantee of spotting their next Active or Passing Encounter before the opposing entity or group spots them. If they roll a one, the next Active or Passing Encounter will spot them before they spot it. This vigilance effect resets at the end of each day, whether the players made use of it or not.

## Pursuits
Since the Interior is a large, open desert, there is a good chance that hostile parties will spot one another some time before they are able to engage in combat. In such situations, one party may choose to flee rather than fight. I resolve pursuits as a series of three opposed CON saves. If the pursuers win two of the three saves, they catch up with their quarry and immediately win the initiative in a combat round. If the fleeing party wins two of the three saves, they escape and cannot be caught.

Sometimes CON may not be the appropriate attribute to test; pursuits over particularly unsteady ground might require DEX saves, for example. The pursuit rules should only be used if there is a reasonable doubt as to the result of the chase.

## Night Watches
When camping in the desert, the PCs may elect a party member to take watch. Whoever is on watch cannot benefit from a Long Rest; instead they will regain only d8 + CON bonus HP. If the party is approached by a hostile creature at night, the referee should ask the character on watch to make a PSY save opposed to the creature’s DEX. Failure grants the monsters a surprise round in combat; the aggressors strike with advantage, and the players cannot respond. After the surprise round is resolved, roll for initiative as normal.

# Weather
---

The climate of Vaarn’s Interior may be simulated using the following method: first, place a marker in the centre of the hex-chart on the opposite page. Then roll a d6 once at the start of each day the party spends in the desert, moving the marker across the hexes in the direction shown and recording the weather indicated by each. If the marker moves off the edge of the chart, it should wrap around onto the opposite side. The exception to this rule is the edges marked with an X; the marker cannot cross these edges and instead it should stay put for that day.

## Weather Effects

### Still
The desert landscape is still, untroubled by the susurration of the heavens. Visibility is good.

### Hazy
The air is still, but mists of a lurid hue hang over the desert. Visibility is impaired and landmarks cannot be seen from a distance. Vigilance checks are made with disadvantage.

### Dust Storm
The wind blows sheets of blue dust across the desert. Visibility is badly impaired. Traveling under such conditions is possible, but the pace is slowed to half normal speed. A three day journey will take six days, and so on. Vigilance checks are made with disadvantage.

### Sand Storm
A howling wind blows a ferocious cloud of azure sand across the desert. Nobody travels in Vaarn’s sandstorms; the PCs must hunker down and wait out the storm. Tents or other makeshift shelters will provide adequate protection. Any encounters rolled during these days are assumed to be seeking shelter from the storm in the same place as the party.

### Heatwave
Urth’s dying sun musters all the warmth it can. PCs must consume twice their normal ration of water per day if they wish to travel during a heatwave.

### Worm-pollen
The sandworms of the Interior reproduce through a baroque, decade-long process of parthenogenesis, culminating in the explosive release of thousands of melon-sized spores into the atmosphere. This worm-pollen drifts back to Urth in ponderous sticky deluges that can last for weeks. Progress through shifting mounds of the stuff is slowed to half normal speed; the upside is that worm-pollen is edible, and many a starving man has been saved by the timely arrival of spores from the heavens. Treat worm-pollen days as providing d4 rations per player.

### Rain
A rare bounty. The parched blue earth is blessed with water. The party may collect 2d6 days of rations per member. In the aftermath of a rainshower, the desert is conquered by a short-lived imperium of majestic flora.

### Prismatic Tempest
The sky bruises with clouds of midnight blue. Howling winds carry scouring sheets of sand across the landscape. Thunder rends the air and polychromatic lightning caresses the desert like the tendrils of a jellyfish deity. No travel of any kind is possible, and the PCs will take 3d6 electrical damage every hour they spend above-ground.

# Exotica

__Not-Sword__  
A blade engraved with paradoxical LogLang glyphs. Synthetic creatures cannot recognise this weapon as a blade, nor can they recognise the bearer of the sword as a living being.  
__Amaranthine Sugar__  
Fabulously valuable substance, extracted through patient husbandry from the bodies of adult sandworms. Ingestion greatly boosts the psychic strength of biological creatures. Each dose grants one new randomly rolled Mystic Gift.  
__Bottled Thicket__  
Glass vial containing weaponised seeds. When the vial is broken, the seeds germinate and begin an astoundingly rapid life cycle, sprouting into a dense tangle of iridescent vines within seconds.  
__Gecko Gloves__  
Finely woven nano-cloth gloves. Allow the wearer’s hands to stick to any surface with a near-unbreakable grip.  
__Tempest Cannon__  
Heavy weapon (d12, 3 slots). Creates tiny, incredibly violent thunderstorms wherever its shells explode. Must be refilled with a day’s worth of water after each combat.  
__The Crimson Cantos__  
Small, unassuming volume of poetry, bound in crimson leather. The book’s contents are neuroactive, and always guaranteed to fling the reader into a murderous rage. Readers must EGO save or violently attack the nearest living creature.  
__Bedazzling Blade__  
Off-handed parrying sword, made in the Fallen Autarchy. Has an inbuilt trick - the blade can briefly glow as brightly as the sun, blinding one’s opponent. Of interest to collectors of rare weapons.  
__Aegis of the Empty-Minded Sage__  
Golden amulet, worn in the centre of the forehead. Renders the wearer immune to mind control, telepathy, and all other forms of psychic intrusion. The aegis does this by totally suppressing the wearer’s memory and personality, rendering the bearer near catatonic until the amulet is removed by a companion. Of dubious utility.  
__Exorcist’s Sidearm__  
The Bullet-witches of Ka-El believed no spirit was beyond the influence of a properly armed gunwoman. This sorcerous sidearm fires a rotating trepanation round, which can violently evict the demons from a possessed man’s skull at an alarmingly long distance.  
__Holo-Bow__  
A novelty crossbow, which ‘fires’ very convincing holograms of arrows.  
__Bounty Beacon__  
May be used outdoors to signal an ancient supply satellite, which drops a Support Pod containing a week’s rations for a long-dead reconnaissance unit. Only works once.  
__Lazarus Cap__  
Grim necrotech helm. If applied to the head of a fresh corpse, will re-activate the brain. The effect only lasts while the cap is worn, and does nothing to arrest the decay of the flesh.  
__Hedondroid__  
Synthetic partycrasher. Crude android that is powered by alcohol, and can unerringly locate parties, orgies, weddings etc. within a five mile radius.  
__Prison Orb of the Miniature Beast__  
A hypergeometric orb the size of a grapefruit, with a scarlet upper hemisphere and a pallid lower hemisphere. Used by the citizens of a long-faded civilisation to imprison a collection of tiny fighting-beasts, and compel them to do battle with other beast-masters. 4-in-6 chance the Orb still contains a Citrine-coated Volt Rat (HD 1, Armour 13, d6 electric tail), hungry and trained to kill without hesitation. 2-in-6 chance the Orb holds nothing but the desiccated corpse of a forgotten beast.  
__Autarch’s Nectar__  
Honeyed golden tonic containing gene-sculpting nanomachines. When drunk by a biological creature, grants a permanent +1 boost to three Ability scores. Only works once.  
__Babble Grenade__  
Neuro-active hand grenade. All living creatures caught within the blast will find themselves unable to understand spoken or written language, and their own speech is likewise gibberish. The effect lasts for a day.  
__Helm of the Unerring Hound__  
Hunting apparatus from the Fallen Autarchy. Black, hound-shaped mask that fits over the human head and inserts biotech probes up the nostrils. Boosts the wearer’s sense of smell to superhuman levels.  
__Mr Skuggly-Wuggly__  
A pink-furred synthetic bear, roughly the size of a domestic cat. Mr Skuggly-Wuggly was designed to amuse the children of a long-lost era, and speaks in comforting rhymes and calming nonsense. Secretly longs for death, but is unable to request this.  
__Ditto Gun__  
Revolver that generates weaponised temporal anomalies when its bullets impact a target. These anomalies inflict a wound identical to the most recent injury suffered by the target, with a matching damage value.  
__The Book of Sand__  
Hypergeometric book with an infinite number of pages, each filled with dense paragraphs of minuscule, utterly illegible text. All efforts to decode the book will fail, although it could provide the fuel for an eternally burning fire.  

# Creating Regions
---

The Referee can generate regions of Vaarn using the following method. This technique will not create detailed maps encompassing every feature of the terrain, but rather a simulacra of a landscape that will fuel a few sessions of gaming.

1. Take a sheet of blank paper. A4, or something of equivalent size, will do nicely.
2. Drop a handful of dice onto the paper. I suggest using five or six dice to create a decent sized region, but there is no upper limit. The more dice you drop, the more regional features you will create. You may use any size of dice up to d20, but be aware that using smaller dice sizes will constrain the results.
3. Draw circles around the dice where they fell, and note the number showing on the dice. Consult the Location Type table below to find what kind of location has been created.
4. Draw lines connecting each location to its neighbors. Locations need not connect to every other location on the map; two or three connections per location is quite adequate. These lines represent known travel routes between the locations. If the locations are very close on the page, roll d6. If they are a moderate distance apart, roll 2d6, and if they are very far apart roll 3d6. This dice roll gives you the number of days it will take to travel on foot between the two locations.
5. Travel routes that connect to even-numbered locations are (relatively) safe. Travel routes between two odd-numbered locations, however, have a hazard associated with them. Consult the table below for inspiration.
6. Now that the broad shape of the region has been created, return to each location and use the tables provided in this zine to generate more specific details about each one. Write down your ideas for each location inside the circles. You are not obliged to abide by the results of the tables if they don’t fit your concept for the region.
7. If you need more details about the region as a whole, roll on the Landscape Type table below to get an idea of the general terrain. You can also roll to find out the origin of the region’s name.
8. Build a region-specific encounter table using the bestiary in these zines. There are more Vaarnish monsters in VOV #1, as well as a sample encounter table. The character of the region you have generated should inform the encounters you seed it with. A region that contains the ruins of a synth factory will likely have malfunctioning synths lurking around, whereas a region with lots of settlements may have an abundance of trading caravans.
9. Last but by no means least, think of a few NPCs who might be found in the region, and what they might want from the party. Use the [Story Seeds](regions/the-interior.md?id=story-seeds) table if you are stuck.

## Bounty Hunter's Camp

_It is commonly known that those seeking to escape the New Hegemony’s justice will flee into the deepest reaches of the Interior, preferring a brief harsh life full of uncertainty to a brief harsh life filled with terrible certainty. It is likewise commonly known that there exists an eccentric and vibrant fraternity of misfits, who attempt - both for profit and for pleasure - to fetch these fugitives back._

## Lair

_The wild places of Vaarn are well-stocked with monstrosities of all stripes. The prudent traveller sleeps lightly, keeps a weapon close at hand, learns to sight these miserable pariahs of the Urth well in advance of their sighting him, and will avoid at all costs the places such creatures dwell._

## Arcology
_Arcologies are self-sufficient, hermetically sealed artificial ecosystems, which protected the true-kin through the fevered centuries of the Great Collapse. They have long since been unsealed and released their inhabitants into the blue lands of Vaarn, but these domes are still a common sight in the wastes and are often occupied, as their subterranean gardens offer a stable source of water and food._

## Hegemony Camp

_Vaarn is considered one of the least desirable postings a Hegemony soldier can receive, and patrolling the Interior is considered the least desirable duty within the Legions assigned to Vaarn. The Hegemony camps found amongst the blue dunes are generally sparse, miserable, and paranoid affairs, garrisoned by the most mutinous and untrustworthy soldiers the New Hegemony has to offer._
