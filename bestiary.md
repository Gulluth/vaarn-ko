Attempting to harm any living being while wearing a Halo will result in the wearer passing out, with no save possible.<br />&nbsp; The Shepherd preaches in clear, ringing tones the futility of opposing the laws of THEMIS.

<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Attacks</b>: Claws (d8) + Recursive Gaze (Special)</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: An incursion from another fevered sphere of reality, a bizarre hypergeometric monster which feeds upon paradox and whose mere regard unwinds the weave and weft of space-time. The Fractalisk resembles a lizard from some angles, a blossoming flower from others, and at times can seem no more substantial than a fan of light reflected upon a wall. In all aspects, however, the creature is virulently dangerous.<br />&nbsp; <b>Recursive Gaze:</b> Any PC fixed with the Recursive Gaze must repeat the action they took the turn before, with no save allowed. This effect is broken if the Fractalisk’s gaze is interrupted, or if the creature dies.<br />&nbsp; <b>Self Similar:</b> Wounding a Fractalisk without the use of hypergeometric weaponry or anti-paradoxical normality gas causes the creature to spit into two identical Fractalisks, which can both target separate PCs with their Recursive Gazes.</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: These rays are found in the shallows of the Sea of Songs, feeding on crabs, squid, and small fish.

<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: The sages of the long-vanished world worked many wonders. One of their quixotic tasks was the breaching of the boundaries between the animal and vegetable kingdoms, which has resulted in several abhuman lineages that exist in present-day Vaarn. Greenwaifs are slender humanoids with symbiotic algae and plant species growing within their flesh. They take all their energy from photosynthesis, requiring only water, and claim to enjoy long lifespans as a result.<br />&nbsp; <b>Empathogens:</b> These abhumans produce a weaponised pollen, which causes hallucinations, delirium, serotonin overproduction, and sometimes death. Each combat round, all biological creatures around the Greenwaif are exposed to a dose of the pollen. They must make an EGO save to remember what they are supposed to be doing, or else fall into a blissful, honeyed stupor. PCs under the effect of the pollen are more open to sharing their secrets and buried emotions, experience instant connections with strangers, and have no desire to harm the Greenwaif.</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: Vaarnish sandworms live the first two stages of their lifecycle as microscopic organisms, before undergoing a rapid metamorphosis into huge majestic filter-feeders. Juveniles, between one and five centuries of age, are the size of passenger trains. Some are trained by the Faa to pull sand-sleds, while others roam free in the deepest Interior. Although not predatory, they can be very aggressive towards sources of unwelcome vibration, like heavy machinery or warding field technology.</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: Believed to have originated on another world, this rare predator is able to alter its body temperature using unusual chemical reactions inside its leathery skin. The creature resembles the terrestrial salamander, but has six limbs and attains the size of an armoured vehicle. It attacks from ambush and rapidly raises the temperature of its flesh to furnace-like levels, cooking its prey alive via mere proximity. The Thermasaur is also capable of lowering its body temperature to sub-zero, draining heat from the air around it. The creature uses this ability to flash-freeze cooked meat for later consumption.<br />&nbsp; <b>Aura:</b> Each round, the Thermasaur can change its body temperature between searingly hot and bitterly cold. The heat or chill is so intense that anyone near the creature suffers d8 automatic damage per round. In addition, the heat forces PCs carrying metal items to EGO save or drop the item due to its scalding temperature. If the Thermasaur’s aura is cold, any liquids near the creature freeze solid, and all ranged attacks are made with disadvantage due to shivering.</td></tr>

The damage starts at d4 and will rise to d12. Prisoners of the tumblesnare must make an opposed DEX save to work their way free. Once the snare has killed a victim it will spend days refuelling, using the fluids and proteins from the broken body.<br />&nbsp; Tumblesnares have no means of aggression besides their ambushes, and always flee if their attack fails.</td></tr>
