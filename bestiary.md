<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: Abandoned justiciar of the Titan THEMIS. Eight-foot tall synth wearing robes of perfect argent, the colour brighter than white.

Anyone implanted with an Argent Halo cannot commit any acts of violence, nor are they able to remove the Halo without expert surgical help. Attempting to harm any living being while wearing a Halo will result in the wearer passing out, with no save possible.

The Shepherd preaches in clear, ringing tones the futility of opposing the laws of THEMIS. It will reason with those it meets, attempting to convince them of the moral logic of accepting a Halo. </td></tr>

The creatures seek out radioactive blightstone and gain sustenance from basking near it, although they supplement this nourishment with a more conventional diet of raw meat. Blightbeasts are immune to damage caused by energy weapons or radiation, and heal d8 HP per round when in the presence of radioactive material. Blightbeasts have no natural predators, their flesh and blood being thoroughly poisonous. Their corpses cannot be used as a source of rations.</td></tr>

Upon awakening, patients of the Chrysalid will find their HP restored to maximum, all Wounds or other ailments healed, and must roll on the <a href="vaarn.github.io/#/ancestries?id=mutations">mutations</a> table to discover how the Chrysalid’s imperfect medical knowledge has impacted them.</td></tr>

It is unclear if these pests were gene-sculpted for a purpose or simply as a jest, but they escaped into the wild and have become a viable Vaarnish species. Roughly the size of a goat, they feed on blood which their razor-tipped trunks drain from sleeping animals and the folk of Vaarn alike. Daggertrunks are highly intelligent, surprisingly stealthy, and very cowardly. They will approach sleeping PCs at night and attempt to siphon blood from their ankles or necks.</td></tr>

These large, cunning canines are able to teleport short distances at will, bypassing solid objects in a flash of soundless, uncanny light. They use this ability to dance in and out of melee range, harrying their prey to exhaustion.

<b>Telefrag:</b> If a Flashhound rolls a natural one during its attack, it has misjudged its teleport and is now occupying the same space as a solid object near its target. The Flashhound dies instantly, causing 3d6 blast damage to everyone nearby.</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: Fleshwarps are cacogenic abhumans, consisting of an atrophied, vestigal head and torso, and a multitude of powerful questing limbs. The creatures are blessed with rapid cellular regeneration, and can heal even mortal wounds within minutes. As they grow, more and more biomass is extruded into their limbs, creating skittering spiderlike abominations.
<br />
<b>Limbs:</b> Roll 2d6 to determine the Fleshwarp’s number of limbs (#Limbs). The creature’s Level is equal to this number.
<br />
<b>Regeneration:</b> The Fleshwarp regains 4hp per combat round, unless burned or dipped in acid.
<br />
<b>Grafting:</b>If the Fleshwarp has a biological target to attack, it will pounce. If the victim fails an opposed STR save, the Fleshwarp attaches one of its limbs to the victim’s torso. The Fleshwarp’s #Limbs and corresponding Level are lowered by 1. The victim must fill an item slots with a special Wound: <b>Grafted Arm.</b> The Grafted Arm has 1 Level and the Armour score of its host.

<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Attacks</b>: Claws (d8) + Recursive Gaze (Special)</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"><b>Notes</b>: An incursion from another fevered sphere of reality, a bizarre hypergeometric monster which feeds upon paradox and whose mere regard unwinds the weave and weft of space-time. The Fractalisk resembles a lizard from some angles, a blossoming flower from others, and at times can seem no more substantial than a fan of light reflected upon a wall. In all aspects, however, the creature is virulently dangerous.
<br />
<b>Recursive Gaze:</b> Any PC fixed with the Recursive Gaze must repeat the action they took the turn before, with no save allowed. This effect is broken if the Fractalisk’s gaze is interrupted, or if the creature dies.
<br />
<b>Self Similar:</b> Wounding a Fractalisk without the use of hypergeometric weaponry or anti-paradoxical normality gas causes the creature to spit into two identical Fractalisks, which can both target separate PCs with their Recursive Gazes.</td></tr>

Gene Thieves are paranoid, destructive cacogen, whose malleable faces take on the aspect of those they wound. They are only semi-intelligent and are no longer capable of convincingly impersonating those they mimic.

<b>Copy-claws:</b> A Gene Thief can take on the facial appearance of any biological creature it wounds with its claws. Their bodies remain scrawny, pink, and hunched.</td></tr>

<b>Agony:</b> Biological characters inflicted with Agony take d6 damage for each combat action they make. Lying still neutralises the venom.</td></tr>

She is believed to be a pursuant of the Path Renewed, who sought eternal youth in the image of the Ouroboros, the world-serpent without end or beginning. She achieved the long-sought apotheosis, but at terrible cost, having shed her humanity like a rough and discarded skin, and lives her eternal life as a voracious chimera of odalisque and viper.
<br />
<b>Beguiled:</b> Characters who have been Beguiled cannot harm the Gorgon, believing her to be the most beautiful creature they have ever seen. They may make an EGO save each round to attempt to fight off this insidious devotion. While Beguiled, they grovel and compete with one another for the Gorgon’s favour.

They take all their energy from photosynthesis, requiring only water, and claim to enjoy long lifespans as a result.
<br />
<b>Empathogens:</b> These abhumans produce a weaponised pollen, which causes hallucinations, delirium, serotonin overproduction, and sometimes death. Each combat round, all biological creatures around the Greenwaif are exposed to a dose of the pollen. They must make an EGO save to remember what they are supposed to be doing, or else fall into a blissful, honeyed stupor.

<b>Aura:</b> Each round, the Thermasaur can change its body temperature between searingly hot and bitterly cold. The heat or chill is so intense that anyone near the creature suffers d8 automatic damage per round.
